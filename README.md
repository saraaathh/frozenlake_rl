# frozenlake_rl

This repository contains a Python implementation of a virtual agent designed to play the Frozen Lake environment from OpenAIâ€™s Gym library using reinforcement learning techniques.

Project Overview
Reinforcement Learning Techniques:
Q-Learning: Trained the agent using Q-learning with Q-table optimization. Achieved a 70% success rate after 10,000 episodes.
Deep Q-Network (DQN): Enhanced performance by deploying a Deep Q-Network, reaching an average success rate of 85% after 1,000 episodes.

Results
Q-Learning Success Rate: 70% after 10,000 episodes.
Deep Q-Network Success Rate: 85% after 1,000 episodes.
